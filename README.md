# OptimizationMethods-MLP
# ðŸ§ Multi-Layer Perceptron for Age Regression
Final Project for Optimization Methods for Data Science

Author: Milad Torabi | Date: December 16, 2024

This repository contains the final project for the Optimization Methods for Data Science course, focusing on building and training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for predicting age using a given set of features. The project demonstrates the use of L-BFGS-B optimization, efficient weight initialization, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal results.
